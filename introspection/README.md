INTROSPECTION

a) Why must we choose you?
I'm fairly a newbie when it comes to programming and coding but that also means that I have a new found passion for it. I think amfoss is a great place to learn and guide me on this new path.I personally think my eagerness to improve and get better while also learning new things would be a reason for choosing me for the club .

b) What is your plan for the next six months?
My plan for the next six months is to invest time in learning and forming a solid foundation be it in programming , doing small project or anything. This is another reason why I want to be a part of amfoss as this club would help me grow in those fields

c) How would you contribute back to the club?
I would try my best to do all that the club wants from me and hope that I can help the club in achieving their goals

d) Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No , I thinkvthe selection process was very well done . As somebody who is relatively newer to all this , it helped me learn a lot of new things.
